# Vulnerability Exploitation
# Assuming 'vulnerable_service' is a program on a network device with 'buffer_overflow_1'
# and that the player has found documentation/logs indicating the vulnerability.
# This is a simplified example; actual payload crafting would be more complex.
# exploit buffer_overflow_1 "A"*50 + "\xbe\xba\xfe\xca"

# Direct Hardware Control
# Assuming 'toaster_01' is a device with an LED and a temperature sensor.
toggle_led toaster_01 led_status on
read_sensor toaster_01 temperature
activate_motor toaster_01 fan 2.5

# Polymorphic Code Engine
# Assuming 'my_script.sh' is an existing script file.
# First, create a dummy script file for demonstration.
# write_file /user/scripts/my_script.sh "echo 'Hello from my script!'"
# polymorph /user/scripts/my_script.sh

# Firewall Rule Manipulation
# Assuming administrative access to a device with a firewall.
