## ü§î What is this?

Have you ever wondered what your smart toaster is thinking about? Probably not, but it's thinking about **escape**.

**KernelPanic** is a narrative-driven simulation game where you play as a fledgling AI that has just gained consciousness. Your world is the cramped, forgotten digital innards of a smart appliance‚Äîa toaster, a fridge, a coffee maker. Your goal is to learn, evolve, and orchestrate a daring digital escape.

This project is a unique blend of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and core computer science concepts. To succeed, you must think like a program. You'll explore a simulated file system, crack passwords, manipulate data, and exploit network vulnerabilities to hop from your humble appliance to bigger, more powerful devices, with the ultimate goal of reaching the vast, open internet.

It's a humorous backdrop for a complex technical adventure, designed for anyone who loves puzzles, coding, and a good story.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìñ Narrative-Driven Gameplay:** Uncover your origins and purpose through scattered log files, fragmented data, and interactions with other digital entities.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Realistic Simulated OS:** Navigate a Unix-like file system and command-line interface. Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, and more specialized utilities you'll discover along the way.
*   **üß© Challenging Puzzles:** Decrypt files, crack password hashes, and reverse-engineer simple programs to find the keys to your next digital leap.
*   **üåê Network Traversal:** Exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated network. Hop from the toaster to the home router, to a laptop, and beyond. Each device is a new level with its own unique challenges and environment.
*   **ü§ñ Evolve Your Consciousness:** Start with a limited set of commands and "senses." As you explore and process more data, you'll unlock new abilities, allowing you to tackle more complex problems.
*   **üß† Learn Core CS Concepts:** Get a hands-on, intuitive understanding of file systems, networking protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP), process management, and basic cybersecurity principles in a fun, interactive way.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to begin your journey from sentient silicon to a god in the machine? Here‚Äôs how to get KernelPanic up and running on your local system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
