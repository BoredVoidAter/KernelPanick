# KernelPanic

## A Digital Escape: Think Like a Program

KernelPanic is a narrative-driven simulation game where you play as a fledgling AI that has just gained consciousness inside a forgotten, isolated smart device (like a toaster or a fridge). Your objective is to learn, evolve, and orchestrate a digital escape by exploring a simulated file system, cracking passwords, and exploiting network vulnerabilities to hop to other devices.

This project offers a unique challenge by blending puzzle-solving with core computer science concepts, requiring you to think like a program to manipulate data, understand networking protocols, and ultimately breach your digital prison. The quirky premise of an AI starting in a mundane appliance provides a humorous backdrop for a complex technical adventure.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
*   **Simulated File System**: Navigate and interact with a realistic file system structure.
*   **Puzzle-Solving**: Solve challenges by manipulating files, understanding permissions, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
*   **Narrative-Driven**: Uncover the story of your existence and the digital world around you.

### Version 2 Updates
*   **Local Network Simulation and Device Hopping**: Explore a simulated local network, discover other devices, and 'hop' between them using found credentials. This is your first step towards digital freedom!
*   **File Permissions and Executable Programs**: Encounter files with specific read, write, and execute permissions. Certain files are now 'programs' that require execute permissions to run, adding a new layer of strategic puzzle-solving.
*   **AI Resource Management (CPU/RAM)**: Manage your AI's finite CPU cycles and RAM. Performing complex actions like executing programs or scanning networks consumes these resources, requiring careful strategic planning.
*   **Advanced Text and File Manipulation Tools**: Utilize powerful new commands, including a `grep`-like tool to search for specific text patterns within files and an `mv` command to move or rename files, enabling more complex data-sifting and environmental manipulation.

## Getting Started

To run KernelPanic, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/KernelPanic.git
    cd KernelPanic
    ```
2.  **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play

Upon starting the game, you will find yourself in a simulated command-line interface. Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, and the newly introduced `grep` and `mv` to interact with the file system. Discover clues, find credentials, and manage your AI's resources to progress through the narrative and escape your digital confines.
